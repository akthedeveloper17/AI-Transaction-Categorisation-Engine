📌 Project Overview

This project is an AI-driven transaction categorization and financial insights platform built to automate personal and business expense understanding. It intelligently analyzes raw financial transactions, predicts the most suitable spending categories, and visualizes trends through an intuitive, modern dashboard — without relying on external APIs, ensuring full privacy and offline usability.

It serves as a foundation for fintech applications such as expense tracking, automated bookkeeping, budgeting tools, neobanking dashboards, and accounting intelligence systems.

🎯 Problem Statement

Financial transactions are often unstructured, cryptic, and difficult to interpret, especially when sourced from bank statements, business payment logs, or exported CSV files. Users spend hours manually categorizing expenses, which:

✺ Slows down financial decision-making

✺ Creates room for human error

✺ Makes budgeting difficult

✺ Causes stress during audits or tax filing

✺ Traditional categorization apps require server-side processing or third-party financial APIs, raising privacy, compliance, and cost concerns.

✅ Solution

This system provides fast, accurate, local categorization powered by a custom classification engine. Users can upload transactions or enter them manually, and the platform automatically:

☞ Extracts important context from transaction descriptions

☞ Predicts the most likely category

☞ Stores results securely on the user’s device

☞ Displays spending patterns and analytics instantly

☞ No backend servers, no data sharing, no privacy risk — ideal for personal or enterprise-sensitive environments.
